Wing Simulation Code

Run Program :
-> Run Main.py 
 
In input section:
-> we can change the airfoil geometry by inputting the file name (Make sure that the airfoil exists inside the Airfoil_DAT_Selig folder, if not just add the .dat inside that folder)

-> we can also change the wing geometry (include: root chord, tip chord, wing swept, and wing span in meter)

-> we can also change the number of grid by determining the number of airfoil points and number of panel spanwise (recommend : 51 airfoil points and 9 wing span panels (half span) for good result)

-> we can choose the aerodynamic input (angle of attack, and free stream velocity)

The program function includes grid generation, aerodynamic calculation, force calculation, and visualization

Output:
-> CL, CM, and time will be shown on the console
-> Panel.dat will be printed out

For visualization using ParaView:
-> run print_vtu.cpp using c++ compiler (It will convert Panel.dat into Panel.vtu which can be read by ParaView)

if using MinGW : type 	-> g++ print_vtu.cpp
						->./a.exe

Panel.vtu file will be created

Visualization (Inside ParaView):
(Install first, if it has not been installed)

Open file -> choose Panel.vtu
change Soild color to -> cp (to visualize the pressure coefficient)
change surface to -> surface with edges (to visualize the wing panels)
opacity could be changed for transparency


The design process of aircraftâ€™s wing is very costly and time-consuming. In
order to reduce the cost of it, numerical simulation can be utilized. One of
the method that can be utilized is Viscous-Inviscid Interaction (VII). VII
method divides the fluid domain into two parts, namely viscous domain and
inviscid domain. Solutions of the invisicid domain outside of the viscous
domain are computed by using Laplace equation and solutions of the viscous
domain are computed by using Boundary Layer equations. In this report,
the Laplace equation solver for inviscid domain will be further investigated.
In the inviscid region of the flow, the fluids are incompressible and irrotational. With the addition of steady-state assumption, the governing equation that governs the inviscid region will turn into laplace equation. Laplace
equation is an elliptic differential equation, then the solution depends on the
boundary conditions of the domain. In this research Panel method is utilized to solve the laplace equation. Panel Method uses linear combination of
solutions from singularity element. In the panel method, wake modelling is
one of the crucial step to obtain an accurate result in the simulation. In this
project, authors tested several wake modelling in the developed soruce code
to solve flow around the wing using Panel Method.
